Coffee Inc Website

This is the website of the landing page for Coffee Inc, a company dedicated to connecting the next generation of professionals through its mobile app that can be found in the App Store. I built this landing page as a solo project to learn and practice building websites in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I built it from scratch first, but then realizing the need for responsive design to accomodate the ever important mobile experience, I added the Twitter Bootstrap framework.

I added mobile functionality for the Bootstrap carousel as well, and for that I must thank Justin Lazanowski and his amazing tutorial that can be found here: http://lazcreative.com/blog/adding-swipe-support-to-bootstrap-carousel-3-0/


The Blog linked on the homepage is built using Wordpress. 

Logo designs are not my own. Sawyer Xie, the CCO of Coffee, is credited for that.
