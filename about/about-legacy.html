		<h3>About Coffee</h3>
		<p>Coffee started from a conversation on Tinder with a young investment banker. The banker expressed the challenges she encountered when trying to casually meet other talented young professionals in New York City. Her number one gripe was the inability to tap these networks to receive information on up & coming companies that were offering employment. Directly after this conversation Nathan, CEO & Sawyer, CCO began to build Coffee.</p>

Ultimately we hope to connect the next generation of professionals & alleviate the unemployment epidemic in the USA.</p>
